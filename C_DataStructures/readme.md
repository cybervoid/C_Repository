# C_DataStrctures
* A workspace for improving an understanding of the fundamental data strctures

## Workspace content:
1. [LinkedLists](./LinkedLists) - data structure of single linked list
2. [DoublyLinkedList](./DoublyLinkedList) - data structure doubly linked list
3. [Stacks](./Stacks) - added data structure section for stacks, stacks are last in first out. (LIFO)
    - Stacks - insertion and deletion allowed on one end
4. [Queues](./Queues) - added a data structure section for queues, queues are first in first out. (FIFO)
    - insertion is performed on one end
    - deletion is perform on the other end
